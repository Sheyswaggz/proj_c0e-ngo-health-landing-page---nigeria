# CODEOWNERS
# This file defines code ownership and automatic review assignment for the repository.
# When a pull request is opened, GitHub automatically requests reviews from the code owners
# of the files being changed. Code owners must approve changes before they can be merged
# if branch protection rules are configured to require code owner reviews.
#
# Syntax: <file-pattern> <owner1> <owner2> ...
# Patterns follow .gitignore syntax. Later matches take precedence over earlier ones.
